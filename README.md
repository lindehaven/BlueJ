# BlueJ

## Background

Felt that I wanted to add another programming language to my portfolio and as
I like coffee my choice was Java ;-).

Started off to get an IDE. Installed Eclipse and NetBeans but was astounded by
the sheer size of them. Lots of menus and configuration options everywhere!
My focus was to learn more about Java and not about the IDE.

Figured that there should be a smaller IDE to grasp. And there were some to
choose from. I chose BlueJ that is small, free, runs on various platforms and
aimed at students learning Java.

Here are my projects.
